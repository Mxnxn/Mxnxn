### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing Master of Professional Analytics (Applied Machine Intelligence) at Northeastern University Toronto Campus. I'm still a young person who has experimented with several initiatives in each of the aforementioned directions.

I have skills and I always tring to master it more by taking complex challeges. In 2019, I started invoicing project while learning ReactJs. Doing same for ML and DL. Because I belive it's best-possible approach to learn as well as work by reading documentation, facing error, etc.

Currently working on 2 projects (Let me know if somebody wants to collaborate):
- Developing Voice-assistance on Gujarati language using python and Data collected from sources and scraping. (I work on this as I get free time). 
- Docusign like web application opensource. (As this is expensive, I will help people to save their money). Developing this using React.js and Django.
- Developing Telegram bot named Gaitonde in Hindi-English (Hinglish) language to download anything from active torrent listings.

Projects I've completed most recently (2022):
- Rain Forest Classification using different machine-learning models like XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- Sarcastic Tweet Classification using LSTM
