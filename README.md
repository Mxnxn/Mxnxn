### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've pursued a Master of Professional Analytics (Applied Machine Intelligence) at Northeastern University Toronto Campus. I'm still a young person who has experimented with several initiatives in each of the aforementioned directions.

I have skills and I always trying to master them more by taking on complex challenges. In 2019, I started invoicing project while learning ReactJs. Doing same for ML and DL. Because I believe it's a best-possible approach to learn as well as work by reading documentation, facing errors, etc.

Currently working on 2 projects (Let me know if somebody wants to collaborate):
- Developing Voice-assistance in the Gujarati language using Python and Data collected from sources and scraping. (I work on this as I get free time).
- Azure ML Studio (Deployment, Hypertunning through AutoML, Designing)
- AWS (Pipelining for development and deployment)

Projects I've completed most recently (2022):
- Rain Forest Classification using different machine-learning models like XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
- Sarcastic Tweet Classification using LSTM.
- Successfully implemented BERT with PyTorch for potential risk classification (NLP) including Economic and risk to health for Sofvie Inc, Toronto, Canada.
